This is a bot I made to tweet random quotes picked from a quote database daily (sometimes every hour. depended on how often i wanted to see it).
It was written in python, and used tweepy hosted through heroku!

Twitter (now X) API went kaput at some point, and I was paying too much for heroku, so I am not keeping up with it anymore. It was fun though, using unicode let me italicise tweet text and everything lol
